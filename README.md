# Boltzmann-Machine
* The code is an implementation within the MATLAB of the Standard Boltzmann Machine model.
* The Implementation is based on Ackley, David H., Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Terrence J. Sejnowski 's paper ***A Learning Algorithm for Boltzmann Machines, Cognitive Science 9.1 (1985).***

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Matlab 2012+

### Installing

* Download repository and extract it.
* Open folder in matlab. (No needs for aditional files or data)

### Executing program

* Run [test.m](./test.m) to see the results of the paper's experiments.

## Note 

The full model and code logic existed in class file [BoltzmannMachine.m](./BoltzmannMachine.m)
